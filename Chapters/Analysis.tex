\section{Preparation, Considerations and Initial Simulations}

\paragraph{}
To design a feasible commercial building incorporating low voltage DC electricity an approximate building size and layout was required. Through liaising with Geoff he suggested contacting QUT's Building Management Services department who have access to building schematics and load data. Geoff Woods and Norman Higgins provided electrical drawings, single line diagrams, architectural drawings and electrical specifications for analysis. Additionally, a computer login to the Electricity Management System (EMS) at QUT was created. This interface tracks all the electricity consumed from every meter on campus. The data is access through a interface closely linked with the single line diagrams of buildings including main switchboards (MSBs), distribution boards (DBs) and transformers. This information is critical to understanding optimal power system design. 

\paragraph{}
The EMS system additionally outlines how the PV system at QUT operates and what power it generates. The solar panels act as a load reducing generator rather than direct appliance powering. During the day the panels generate electricity and with a regulator and converter combination the DC generated power is converted to AC and fed into the University's power systems. The major difference between this design and the one which this project seeks to design is the panels will be directly powering loads. 

\subsection{Draft Floorplan}

\paragraph{}
Before the schematics and floor plans for QUT's buildings were made available, an approximate small office area was modelled in AutoCAD with offices of 5 \si{m^2}. The purpose of this simulation was to analyse approximate lighting loads for the environment.

\paragraph{}
After the initial room plans for created, the Australian Standards AS/NZS 1680.2.2 Interior and Workplace Lighting were consulted.

These two data points were used for the initial draft planning of designs. This is not an accurate representation of a building, it was a starting point to work from once the more accurate schematics and plans were accessed. The next stage was to import the simple floor plan CAD file into Dialux4.13. This is a lighting design software solution to model options and predict approximate load demands that the LVDC system will be required to power.  

\paragraph{}
Through personal experience in building services design, I had an approximate idea of what amounts of lighting would be required for a 5 \si{m^2} room. I also knew that I would use LED down lights for simplicity and affordability.The difficult part is finding commercially available products that operate at a voltage level at either 48 \si{V DC} when the voltage drop over cabling is removed or at another level where an efficient DC to DC converter could be used. My goal was to have the average lux between 300 \si{lux} to 400 \si{lux}. This value was chosen as a technical office is an accurate assessment of most corporate buildings. As seen in Table 4 below, 7 20 \si{w} LED down lights reaches this specification.
