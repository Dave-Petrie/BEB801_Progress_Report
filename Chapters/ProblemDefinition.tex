\section{Research Problems}

\paragraph{}
The key problem that this research paper will be targeting is the feasibility of implementing a separate DC power distribution system for the specific purpose of powering LED lighting circuits and simple electronics. Additionally, the goal is to implement these systems into a commercial building and apartment setting within Australia. For a stronger understanding and case study, Brisbane city will be analysed due to the large amounts of sun and numerous high rises. Designs will be tested through physical devices where possible or software simulations otherwise. In order to answer this key question and complete the project, sub questions were separated and discussed.

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep-0.5em 
\item Can direct current power be a suitable alternative to alternating current when efficiencies are compared?
\item Is 48V the most suitable option for this system?
\item Could a photo-voltaic system be implemented to power these circuits?
\item Will a separate circuit that powers the lighting be possible?
\item Could these proposed power distribution methods be implemented in commercial buildings?
\end{enumerate}
