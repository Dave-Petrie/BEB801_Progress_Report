\section{Project Questions}

\paragraph{}
The following section will go into technical detail of the five questions that this project will analyse. Due to the fact this is a progress report and not the final, there are not solutions to all answers however mechanisms put in place so that the solutions can be found. If a question has not been solved, it will be outlined how the solution will be found over the remaining semester.
